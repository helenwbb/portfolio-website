      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Helen and I am a UI Designer currently living in the Northern Virginia area. Living on a mountain, I am inspired by nature’s simplicity and hope to translate its intuitive intrinsic concepts into my own designs. I
        have a passion to create effortless solutions within interfaces that not only make the interaction with the UI fun, but memorable, creating lasting connections between users and brands.
        I started my UI journey after the pandemic hit. Before finding UI, I worked in event planning and before that, customer service positions while I studied for my Bachelor’s in Marketing. I always enjoyed my work, but I always felt the
        need for a more creative option. While marketing is malleable in some ways, I realized after taking a product development class I wanted something more.</p>

      <p>While listening to music on YouTube one day, I got an ad for UI design before my next song played. Usually I skip ads, but something told me to give it a listen. I realized everything the ad was saying sounded like what I was looking
        for. Before I knew it, I was watching tons of UI “day in the life videos” and asking my family members with a career in UI what it was all about. It sounded like a perfect mesh of marketing and creative freedom, so I decided to take
        the plunge and get certified. Thanks for CareerFoundry, I am where I am today. When I am not watching UI videos or looking up new UI art on Behance, I like to write and record relaxing indie music. My stomping grounds belong to local
        cafes and eclectic venues. Last year, I was humbled enough to be awarded second place in an East Coast songwriting competition. Even though the pandemic has closed many venues, I still play music performing in Zoom / Instagram
        concerts- it is a definite adjustment, but the community is still there, making it very fun- connecting with others is the best thing about music to me. Outside of music, I enjoy yoga, raising bonsai plants (my favorite are weeping
        cherry trees), playing Final Fantasy, and scouring cosmetics and fashion magazines for interesting color palettes and new outfit inspiration.</p>
