      <p>Beautify is a luxury cosmetics shopping app with an easy navigation that was inspired by simple customer journey maps to unite and communicate its purpose throughout all its wireframes / screens.</p>
      <p>User flow testing and multiple iterations of the wireframes resulted in a clear, concise flow that allows Beautify to fulfill its goal of an easy navigation to help customers find exactly what they are looking for in a timely manner.</p>

      <h2>Creating Beautify</h2>
      <p>To appeal to the immediate gratification needs of the luxury consumer, Beautify was centered around four principles: the ability to have a shopping experience anywhere, swift checkout, easy searching filters, and a fast sign up.
        To do this, however, Beautify also had to also be elegant, simple, and clean from a UI perspective. To visualize all these theories coming together, I created a rough draft of user flowcharts:
        One for an easy sign up, easily accessible products, and one for checkout with many payment options.</p>

      <p>Once the flows were down, the wireframes came easier to mind. I created wireframes for each flow and built the rest of the remaining app pages around these flows, filling in any gaps I found in the process.</p>
      <p>With the wireframes finished, testing was on the way. I asked participants about my layout and checkout flow through the use of a working prototype to gain insight on any changes I needed to make.</p>

      <p>Testing revealed my original colorstory was too hard to read for users and my icons, while easy to press, were a tad too large. Thanks to testing I scrapped my old colorstory and went an entirely new route. I decided to keep the gold but go
        for a more stark contrast to aid in reading- a black, white, and gold with a royal purple accent to convey luxury.</p>
      <p>With the colors fixed, I tested my app again. This time, it was easy to read for users, and with everything easier to view, the streamlined process were noted by users! With the wrong colors gone, other parts of my app were being noticed and
        appreciated. I was truly grateful for my participants. With this feedback, I created my final prototype and mockups.</p>
